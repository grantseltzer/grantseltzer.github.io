      <description>Bialys Bialys are a traditional roll that are fundamental to Ashkenazi Jewsish cuisine. They were a staple at bakeries in New York throughout the 20th century but are hard to find outside of areas with large Ashkenazi populations. Bagels simply get all the glory.
Whereas bagels are supposed to be tough and chewy, Bialys are soft, light, and have an even airy crumb structure. Instead of having a hole, they have a divet in the center which has caramelized onions.</description>

      <description>Miami rolls + Challah Miami rolls are a challah based onion pocket roll. They&amp;rsquo;re very soft, sweet, flavorful, and delicious. Pretty traditional to jewish bakeries in New York. I worked at a bakery all throughout high school and these were my favorite things there. When they closed down in 2020 I tried to get the recipe but the owner wouldn&amp;rsquo;t share it with me. Through 15+ iterations I have engineered a recipe that is exactly how I remember them.</description>
