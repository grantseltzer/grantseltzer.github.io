      <description>&amp;lt;- recipes
Miami rolls are a challah based onion pocket roll. They&amp;rsquo;re very soft, sweet, flavorful, and delicious. Pretty traditional to jewish bakeries in New York. I worked at a bakery all throughout high school and these were my favorite things there. When they closed down in 2020 I tried to get the recipe but the owner wouldn&amp;rsquo;t share it with me. Through 10+ iterations I have engineered a recipe that is exactly how I remember them.</description>
