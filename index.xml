      <description>This post will introduce you to cgroups. The goal is to give a comprehensive enough explanation of cgroups and subsystems to broadly understand what they accomplish and how. The major focus will be on the CPU cgroup. The second section and third section will explore using cgroups from the command line. 
Control groups (or cgroups) are a feature of the Linux kernel by which groups of processes can be monitored and have their resources limited.</description>

      <description>This post will introduce you to the basic concepts of disassembly and walk through writing a simple disassembler in Go. The goal is to make the whole concept of disassembly as accessible as possible and hopefully give you, the reader, a takeaway or two about how compiled Go binaries work. 
Assembly code cannot lie. By reading assembly we become as close as possible to knowing whatâ€™s being run on our computer chips.</description>
