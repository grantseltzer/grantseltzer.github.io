      <description>This post discusses building go test binaries and walking through them with delve 
I recently was working on debugging a unit test I wrote in Go. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out why one of my test cases was causing a runtime error that never happened when running my actual program. I was using a runtime directive so I suspected there may be some difference between doing a go test and a go run.</description>

      <title>Standardized Streams and Shells</title>

      <description>In this post we discuss how standardized streams (stdin/stdout/stderr) work on Linux, especially related to shells. 
Every well known operating system has a concept of standardized streams. These consist of standard input, output, and error. As their name purports, they are the standard places for proccesses to read input, and send output. They&amp;rsquo;re a crucial concept that allows various running processes to easily communicate.
Standardized streams enable you to string together multiple commands with a pipe (|) in your shell like this:</description>

      <title>Using dynamic libraries in static Go binaries</title>

      <description>This post highlights a linker directive in Go. It allows us to import functions from a dynamic library even when CGO is disabled. I use the example of a contribution I recently made to the net and runtime packages to demonstrate its use case. 
Go has many little known features that allow you to give instructions to the compiler, linker, and other parts of the toolchain using special comments. Dave Cheney wrote an excellent post on them here.</description>

      <title>The Beauty of io.Writer</title>

      <description>In this post we explore best practices of defining interfaces in Go. We use io.Writer to break down patterns and antipatterns. 
A perfect example of a properly designed Go interface is io.Writer:
type Writer interface { Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) }  It is short, simple, and powerful. The Write method takes a very generic slice of bytes and writes it to something.
In Rob Pike&amp;rsquo;s Go Proverbs talk he talks about how in Go, interfaces are not declared to be satisfied, they&amp;rsquo;re satisfied implicitly.</description>

      <title>Understanding cgroups</title>

      <description>This post will introduce you to cgroups. The goal is to give a comprehensive enough explanation of cgroups and subsystems to broadly understand what they accomplish and how. The major focus will be on the CPU cgroup. The second section and third section will explore using cgroups from the command line. 
Control groups (or cgroups) are a feature of the Linux kernel by which groups of processes can be monitored and have their resources limited.</description>

      <description>This post will introduce you to the basic concepts of disassembly and walk through writing a simple disassembler in Go. The goal is to make the whole concept of disassembly as accessible as possible and hopefully give you, the reader, a takeaway or two about how compiled Go binaries work. 
Assembly code cannot lie. By reading assembly we become as close as possible to knowing whatâ€™s being run on our computer chips.</description>
